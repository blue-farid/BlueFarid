# Here is ACPC!

### ICPC!

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is an algorithmic programming contest for college students. Teams of three, representing their university, work to solve the most real-world problems, fostering collaboration, creativity, innovation, and the ability to perform under pressure. Through training and competition, teams challenge each other to raise the bar on the possible. Quite simply, it is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world.

### ACPC!

So far, The Amirkabir Collegiate Programming Contest (ACPC) is a local qualification for ICPC.

## What was my role in this contest?

I served as one of the two technical heads during this crazy journey! My primary responsibility was developing the entire back-end of the [**web-site**](http://icpc.aut.ac.ir) dedicated to managing contest registrations.
